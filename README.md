lazy_prime.s has a complexity of n* so as ur input number increases it takes longer to calculate. It works by checking for divisiblity of every number until the given input number.Example: if the input is 100 it will check for divisbility for all numbers from 2 upto 99. So unless ur lazy to write pls dont use this code, its bad.


primenos_upto100.s on the other hand is comparitively more optimized and is a better code compared to the former. It checks for divisibility of 2,3,5,7 and 11 for each number and stores them in the memory. Please learn how this works. Use this and the computer gods will thank you.
